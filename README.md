# Automate-WhatsApp-with-Selenium
Facebook’s WhatsApp is almost universal as the messaging service of choice on our mobile devices, with over 2 billion users worldwide. In this session, we’ll show you how to schedule and automate message sending to multiple people on WhatsApp using the Selenium web framework. Selenium is a very powerful library for browser automation and we will use its Chrome driver capabilities through Python to set up a bridge to WhatsApp’s desktop version.
